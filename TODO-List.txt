Kernel Wish List and TODO:
  +--------------------------------------+
  |  - = no priority  | 1*= priority # 1 |
  |  2*= priority # 2 | 3*= priority # 3 |
  |  4*= priority # 4 | 5*= priority # 8 |
  |  w-ext2 = with the creation of the   |
  |           ext2 filesystem            |
  |  means = I have no idea how to do    |
  |          this                        |
  |  NK = Non-kernel program             |
  +--------------------------------------+

1*- Create a ext2 filesystem with typical 'root' directories
	+ Create drivers (or kernel functions) to make files, directories, etc.
	+ Create directories {
		'boot' (grub info), 
		'bin' (programs), 
		'home' (userspace), 
		'proc' (process info), 
		'sys' (kernel data),
		'var' (logs and such) }
	+ Allow Grub to locate the kernel programs within the filesystem, load them, and run them.
		'boot/grub/menu.lst', 'stage1', 'stage2', 'e2fs_stage1_5' etc
2*- KinDos:
	+ make system variables so programs can access their arguments from there. {
		arguements can be private [only that program can use them], soft-public [soft arguments that are only saved from that session], hard-public [stored in /var/envi/sys_envi_var.dat], kernel-var [?? maybe a kernel module will take care of this for me... I will call it kvari.mod] }
	+ w-ext2 allow KinDos to execute programs that are externel to Kernel. 
	+ w-ext2 make KinDos an external program from Kernel
		make a file (rc1 that hold the name of programs that should be executed once kernel is nested)

3*- Full VGA access and pixel manipulation program/driver:
	+ 1st - create a boot up logo image and then drop to KinDos

- Create fully functioning DATE program.
	+ Can request CMOS date and time && display it in proper format
	+ w-ext2 filesytem save the requested CMOS date to a file and edit it everytime a second passes
	+ w-ext2 filesytem allow user to specify date and time. (because CMOS might not be correct)

- Create a means of executing sound.
	+ First: a system beep sound to show an user error has occured (using RAW music files)
	+ Second: allow an NK program to play music (WAV, mp2-mp3 etc)
- Create a means of allocating ram
- Create a program that can read the CPU (a 'top' program)
- Integrate USB drivers
- Create a means of networking.
