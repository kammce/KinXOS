Some remarks om compiling the sources


* compiling the sources require VtoolsD.
* before you compile, edit the makefiles and alter
the three defines to fit your local configuration
* issue nmake only in "debug", "fulldebug" or "release"
directories
* There are still some warnings left when you compile. Ignore
them, one of these days I'll fix these
